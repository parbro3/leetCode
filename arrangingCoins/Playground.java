            This confused me for a bit until I found a good youtube video to explain it.

            Then set this equal to the total which is technically n.. but we're going to call it N

            N = n*(n+1)/2

            Then make it a quadratic formula
            0 = n^2 + n - 2N    where N is the number given to you as the input

            then solve the quadratic formula with  ...   (-b +- sqrt(b^2 - 4ac) ) /2a

            which becomes ....      (-1 +- sqrt( 1 - 4*1*(-2*N))) / 2

            casting it as an int will give you the last full row

        return (int)(-1 + Math.sqrt( 1 + 8*(long)n)) / 2;

        int counter = 0;
        while(n >= 0){
            counter += 1;
            n -= counter;
        }
        return --counter;
    }
